# Movie theater database

 ## Tabels:  
*  customer  
*  ticket  
*  concession  
*  movie  
*  items  
 

*  customer <-> concession : one to many  
My logic here is that a customer can have many concession vists.  
* movie <-> ticket: one to many  
For this one it was pretty straight forward, you can only watch one movie per ticket.  
*  customer <-> tickets one to many  
But a customer can buy several tickets, did someone say date night?
*  items <-> concession: many to many
unlimited snacks need I say more? well probably . 
Logic here is that you can have a lot of diffrent items.  

I also did a lot of playing with altering tables, thank goodness that was the 'fun' bit, as I forgot a few things, but I'll never tell!
